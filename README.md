## Flower Classifier with Pytorch

This repository contains my implementation of an image classifier using Pytorch. The classifier was trained using a dataset of 102 flower species.

Despite this, the implementation is general enough to train the network with any iamge dataset of your choice.

I had a lot of fun working on this project and had the opportunity to learn a little bit of Pytorch in the way.


Enjoy!
